# VoynichBruteForce

## Motivation
The Voynich Manuscript (VMS) represents a centuries-old linguistic enigma characterized by a unique statistical profile that defies standard cryptographic explanation. 

This project attempts a computational evolutionary approach, proceeding from the assumption that the text was generated by a specific, deterministic set of rules applied to a source text by a human operator in the 15th century. 

By modeling the problem space of all possible text generation methods, I aim to reverse-engineer the manuscript's origin through high-volume simulation.

## Implementation
The application utilizes a genetic algorithm to evolve pipelines of text modifiers, iteratively mutating and breeding different encryption or obfuscation strategies. 

These candidate pipelines are tested against the manuscript's known statistical anomalies, such as its adherence to Zipf’s Law, its unusually low conditional character entropy, and its rigid word-length distribution. The system attends to historical plausibility by assigning a cognitive complexity score to each method, penalising algorithms that would be too mentally taxing for a medieval scribe to perform fluently. 

The software aims to converge on a sequence of operations that reproduces the Voynich's statistical signature from plaintext, hinting at the methods used by its creators.

## Assumptions and limitations

Because the Voynich is so singular, any attempt to explain it will inevitably rest on various assumptions about its nature. These assumptions are probably a large factor in why it has resisted analysis for so long, but we cannot work without assumptions: the best we can do is state them clearly, instead of leaving them implicit. So the following are mine.

- The VMS was produced by an effective method. That is, the original creator began with a plaintext and, through some process, iterative or otherwise, simple or complex, applied various transformations to produce the Voynichese text.
  - I think this is a highly justified assumption.
  - The Voynich exists. Someone, in 15th-century Europe, sat down and composed it. There must have been a way they did it.
  - The statistical profile of the VMS is, I feel, too striking to have been the product of off-the-cuff, free-flow writing for a text of its length and complexity. (This does *not* assume the source text was not asemic.)
  - In other words: my assumption is that the strange statistical elements of the VMS could only have arisen from the result of an effective method, not improvisation.
- An effective method which produces ciphertexts that strongly follow the statistical profile of the VMS is likely to be related to the actual method used by the historical creators of the VMS. Put more strictly: such a method is *more likely* to be related to the actual method than a method which produces ciphertexts with wildly diverging statistical profiles.
- The historical method was likely generative or constructive in nature - it added structure - rather than just transforming or hiding structure, like standard cryptographic measures.
- Some statistical elements are of greater importance than others. For instance, the VMS's remarkably low H2 entropy is one of the standout features which clearly marks it as not being a simple substitution cipher of natural language. (In other words, it is not secretly 'just Turkish', 'just old French', and so on.) Any method claiming to produce Voynichese *must* demonstrate this feature. In contrast, other features are granted lesser weight by the evolutionary algorithm.
- The space of plausible methods can be narrowed by genetic/evolutionary processes.
- The elementary steps I have implemented for the effective method contain functional equivalents for those used by the historical VMS creators. If they used completely unknown techniques or instruments, they will not be found by this program, as they live outside the search-space it explores. While I may not replicate the exact physical mechanism (e.g., a specific Cardan Grille), I assume the mathematical transformation performed by that tool is represented within my library of modifiers.
- The method used to produce the VMS was consistent across its composition. If a fundamentally different method was used for different sections of the text, this approach will fail, as it is aiming to emulate a composite statistical profile, rather than a 'genuine' one. This could be remedied (at least in theory) by deriving a statistical profile for smaller chunks of the VMS, rather than the entire text.
- The creators of the VMS were bound by the standard motivations of cognitive complexity. That is, they did not choose an arbitrarily complex method for its own sake, when a simpler method existed that achieved the same result. As such, unnecessarily complex methods are penalised by the genetic algorithm. This assumption may be wrong depending on the circumstances of the text's creation or the psychology of its creator (religious mania, a sincerely-held ideology, etc.).
- The transliterations of the Voynich are broadly accurate. A fundamentally incorrect transliteration scheme would produce a different statistical profile for things like character entropy, rendering this approach incoherent.

### Non-assumptions

- I do not assume the source text for the VMS held semantic content. It could have been asemic writing, or a composite of many unrelated texts. I hold that whatever method the original authors used would impose the VMS's distinctive statistical profile regardless of the meaningfulness of the source text.
